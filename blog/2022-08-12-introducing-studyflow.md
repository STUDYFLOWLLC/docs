## Why We Made Studyflow

If you have spent any amount of time in college, you will find that everyone has very different study habits. In fact, I've heard it said that the first year of college isn't a waste if you learn how to study.

This just sits wrong with me. Sure, sometimes you must learn from experience, and sure, experience may be the best teacher, but then why are you at college in the first place? Well, you are there to learn from other people who already know what they are doing. So why aren't they teaching you how to study?

You may have heard a spiel like that before, "ahh learn to learn blah blah blah," but still, no one probably ever taught you how to learn. Well, here we are.

## Why Students Need Studyflow

A good starting place (if not <i>the</i>) starting place for any research is Google. Type "student productivity" into YouTube, and I promise you that, no matter how warped your Youtube algorithm is, you will see videos by Ali Abdaal.

This is where I started too, and while Ali Abdaal has some useful content, if he truly figured out student productivity, he would be out of business. There is **always** another app, technique, or strategy that he can share. The same goes for any other content creator in the space.

So what is left is a half-hearted recommendation of many apps, like Notion, Todoist, Google Docs, etc. Which do you choose? How do you use them? Let's say you choose Notion to manage all of your notes. Okay, well check out someone's videos on Notion templates! "No wait, <i>my</i> Notion templates are better!", "No, why are you using Notion in the first place!"

So you finally decide to use <i>w</i> Notion template with <i>x</i> task managing software (because Notion task managing sucks. Believe me, I've been there and done that) and <i>y</i> note-taking app on your iPad and <i>z</i> review schedule.

And then it doesn't work. You don't get straight A's. Your dad tells you, "Did you study enough?", "Did you party too much?" Chances are you studied enough (in hours, not efficiency) and didn't party too much, but your study system just kinda sucked. But there are too many variables - <i>w, x, y, z</i> - for you to figure out where you went wrong. This is the exact problem that Studyflow fixes.

## What Studyflow Actually Does

We finally arrive at the point. Here are Studyflow's core features.

1. Task managing for students. <i>Every</i> other major task manager is made for **employees of mega corporations**. Studyflow is **built for students**, and handles labelling, grouping, and planning for you.
2. Flashcards. Create a flashard stack. Review them (swiping left for wrong, up for meh, and right for correct). All the flashcards you create have an **individual review history** that you can view. (Coming soon) we will recommend to you what flashcards to review next.
3. Repetitions. A repetition includes a stack of flashcards and a set of review tasks (based on a scientific **spaced repeition** schedule), so you can memorize all the content you need to know.
4. Flows. A text editor that can handle flashcards, tasks, and repetitions. What usually takes 4 apps and mass confusion now works **beautifully together all in one document**.
5. Flow sharing. **Share your flows publicly** or grant other students permission to see your private flows.
6. Automation. Connect your Google Drive account, then take a note in your note-taking app of choice (we recommend Notability or Goodnotes), and a flow with a repetition and note template will **automatically** be made for you.

Barring automation, each of these numbers respectively have their own apps. Getting them all to work together is very difficult and requires immense discipline (more on the history of Studyflow soon). We have hand-picked the best features of all the great productivity apps, tailored them to students, and have made them easy to use.
Moral of the story: Studyflow is one variable. If you don't get great grades you know what is wrong. We won't let you down. [Sign up now](https://studyflow.ai/login)
