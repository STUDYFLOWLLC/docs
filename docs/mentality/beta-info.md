# Studyflow is in Open Beta

We aren't experts. We encourage community feature requests and bug reports.

## Studyflow is Free For All Students

Studyflow is not a complete app. We have a great number of features that we would like to add, and know that the current experience is not bug-free. Instead of waiting, polishing off the app, and trying to monetize Studyflow, we have decided to release it for free to the public in open beta. We have done this because we believe that even in its current, incomplete state, Studyflow is an invaluable service to Students.

## Community Feedback

Making Studyflow free has a major benefit to us: community feedback.

Students can submit feature requests and report bugs inside the app [here](https://studyflow.ai/beta)
